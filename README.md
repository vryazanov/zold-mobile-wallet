2. Download `Expo` application from `Play Market` / `Apple Store`.
3. Open application and sign up.
4. Inside the repo execute `npm run start`. Browse page with the following URL will be opened: `http://localhost:19002/`
5. In the left bottom side of the page there will be a QR code (or you can just open URL in the mobile browser, the link will be provided near QR code), scan it and open from your mobile.
